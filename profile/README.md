# DuckMath

**DuckMath** is a community-driven project dedicated to preserving and providing access to unblocked online games. Our mission is to archive, maintain, and share browser-based games so they remain playable for years to come.

## What We Do

### Game Archiving & Preservation
- Host a growing library of 200+ games, including classic Flash titles and modern HTML5 games.
- Preserve downloadable raw game files for offline enjoyment and long-term access.

### Unblocked Access
- Provide proxy support and mirror hosting so games remain accessible in restrictive environments (e.g., schools, workplaces).
- Keep a lightweight, fast-loading site with minimal ads for smooth gameplay.

### Leaderboards & Community Engagement
- Track high scores with a fully functional leaderboard system.
- Encourage friendly competition and community interaction.

### Developer Collaboration
- Open-source repositories for contributors to add games, fix bugs, and improve features.
- Actively maintained with regular updates and new content.

### Game Variety
- Feature a diverse mix—from nostalgic Flash classics to new HTML5 hits.
- Include popular titles like *OvO*, *ShellShock.io*, and many more.
